# 1.Write a Python program which will remove all zeros from an IP address.

  def remove(ip):
      split = ip.split('.')
      splitedd_ip = '.'.join(str(int(i)) for i in split)
  
      return splitedd_ip
  ip_address = "2345.3.034"
  splitedd_ip = remove(ip_address)
  
  print(splitedd_ip)

#2.Given an list of numbers. Find the maximum element in list.Without use max function.

  def max_number(list):
      max_element = list[0]
      for num in list:
          if num > max_element:
              max_element = num
  
      return max_element
  
  numbers = [1,2,3,4,7,5,10,32]
  maximum = max_number(numbers)
  print(maximum)

#4. Write a program that takes in a string as input, counts and outputs the number of vowels.

    def find_vowel(word):
        vowels = ['a','e','i','u','o']
        count = 0
    
        for i in word:
            if i in vowels:
                count += 1
    
        return count
    
    word = input("Your word")
    result = find_vowel(word)
    print(result)

#5. Write a function. Create the list which elements are products between two neighbours.

    def product_two_neighbours(lst):
        list = []
        for i in range(len(lst) -1):
            list.append(lst[i] * lst[i + 1])
        return list
    
    list = [1,3,5,7,9]
    result = product_two_neighbours(list)
    print(result)

#7.Given a list of strings. Find the strings with maximum and minimum lengths in array. Print the sum of their lengths.
